# Springboot Test Project

This project is designed as a personal test for using Springboot with an H2 database, and user authentication. The current models include the "Person" (user model), "PersonalInfo" (which is in a one-to-one relationship with "Person"), "Address" (which a "Person" can have an unlimited amount of), and "Club" (which can have an unlimited amount of "Person"s assigned to a "Club" and vice versa).

This repository is still a work in progress. User authentication, and tests have not been completed.
